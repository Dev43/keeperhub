## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (already locked, do NOT re-debate during planning)

- Marketplace lives as the third TAB on `/hub` (NOT a standalone `/marketplace` route — this overrides the original v1.11 plan; ROADMAP rewritten in commit `adc9632f`; shipped in Phase 44)
- Tag URLs use `/hub/tags/[tag]` path segment (NOT `?tag=` query)
- Phase 44 ships popularity-only sort; earnings sort deferred to v1.11.x or later (privacy review pending)
- Zero new npm dependencies needed
- View toggle persisted in cookie (NOT localStorage)
- Single `WorkflowIOOverlay` with shadcn Tabs (NOT two side-by-side overlays)
- Import schema hardened (`.passthrough()` -> `.strict()`) as part of Phase 42
- Phase 43 + Phase 44 require `/frontend-design:frontend-design` skill during planning
- One PR per phase, all targeting `staging`
- Reserved-slug validator centralized in `@/lib/workflow/reserved-slugs` and reused by both `workflows.listedSlug` (workflow PATCH) and `publicTags.slug` (public-tags POST). Validator has zero imports for clean tree-shaking; HUB-15 error copy `"{slug}" is a reserved word and cannot be used.` is the binding contract for both routes.
- Use-template CTA dark foreground uses existing `--color-bg-inverse` token — no new `--color-on-accent-text` token needed (UI-SPEC §Open Issues #2 resolved). Toast copy after duplicate succeeds: `Template ready in your workflows` (UI-SPEC Copywriting Contract).
- HubViewToggle uses a manual WAI-ARIA radiogroup (two `<button role="radio">` with arrow-key handling) NOT `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` — keeps zero-new-deps promise; UI-SPEC §Open Issues #1 resolved (43-06).
- `hub_view` cookie is NOT HttpOnly — explicit per CONTEXT.md HUB-19 to allow client-side fallback reads (43-06).
- `app/hub/page.tsx` is now a server component reading `cookies()`; client logic lives in `app/hub/_view-shell.tsx` (underscore prefix avoids creating a route segment) — pattern reused by `app/hub/tags/[tag]/page.tsx` when that route lands.
- `/hub/tags/[tag]` route is server-rendered with `generateStaticParams` (build-time prerender of every public tag) + `dynamicParams=true` + `revalidate=3600` (on-demand ISR for tags added after deploy). Reserved slugs and unknown slugs both 404 via `notFound()`. Empty tag pages emit `robots: { index: false, follow: true }` instead of 404 (43-02).
- `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` now exist as Next.js metadata routes; sitemap enumerates `publicTags` rows; robots disallows `/hub?` and `/marketplace?` query-string variants (43-02).
- Per-tag OG image generation is deferred to HUB-FUTURE-02; all tag pages share `${baseUrl}/api/og/hub` (43-02).
- List row uses `<article role="row">` with `::before` overlay (NOT a `<tr>` and NOT a wrapping `<a>`) to keep tile/row symmetry and preserve nested-button A11y for the vote cluster. The rowgroup wrapper is a `<div role="rowgroup">` with a scoped `biome-ignore lint/a11y/useSemanticElements` -- `<tbody>` cannot legally contain `<article>` (43-07).
- List-view zebra striping uses two new tokens: `--ds-row-stripe` (Layer 1 primitive, oklch-alpha 0.4) + `--color-row-stripe` (Layer 2 alias). Phase 43 is dark-only so no `.dark` override needed (43-07).
- Vote-state pattern is duplicated between `WorkflowTemplateGrid` and `WorkflowTemplateList`; refactor to a shared hook is a deliberate post-Phase-43 follow-up (43-07).
- Phase-44 marketplace-badge slot in the List row is reserved between price-per-call and the vote cluster but renders nothing in Phase 43 -- the comment marker in `workflow-template-row.tsx` is the insertion point.
- Anonymous + auto-anonymous Use-template flow uses an HttpOnly `pending_template` cookie (Path=/, SameSite=Lax, Max-Age=600) set by POST /api/auth/template-intent and atomically cleared by GET. PendingTemplateRunner mounts in app/layout.tsx (broadest scope — UI-SPEC §Open Issue #3 resolved) and triple-guards re-fire via useRef + sessionStorage TTL + server-side one-shot cookie (43-05).
- `.npmrc` extended to add all `@biomejs/cli-*` platform shim packages to `minimum-release-age-exclude` — `pnpm dlx`-driven biome resolution kept failing the 3-day-old gate even when @biomejs/biome itself was excluded. Fix landed via the 43-05 execution (commit 2395d087).
- Hub sidebar tag-link clicks wrapped in React 19 `useTransition` + `router.push(href, { scroll: false })`; `<Link>` preserved as the rendered element so cmd/ctrl/shift/alt/middle-click defer to the browser default for open-in-new-tab; `e.preventDefault()` only fires on plain left-click. The `<WorkflowSearchFilter>` mount was removed from `app/hub/_view-shell.tsx` (the component file remains but has zero consumers; deletion deferred to a future cleanup) — UAT gaps #3 + #4 closed (43-13).
- Dev-only back/forward hydration recovery `<Script>` lives at the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`, commit `06c1867f`), supersedes the per-page Phase-43 workaround on `app/hub/layout.tsx` (commit `cef214f0`, now deleted via commit `d4e61a36`). Detection contract `performance.getEntriesByType('navigation')[0]?.type === 'back_forward'` → `window.location.reload()`, JSX-gated on `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"` for full production DCE. Companion artifacts: ADR `specs/architecture/back-forward-hydration.md` (commit `2df832d1`), unit test `tests/unit/root-layout-bfcache.test.ts` (commit `30a05ad0`), dual-mode Playwright suite `tests/e2e/playwright/back-forward-hydration.test.ts` + `playwright.config.ts` `NEXT_BUILD_MODE` switch + `pnpm test:e2e:bfcache:{dev,prod}` scripts (commits `554e7d93`, `84d1eb4f`, `69063092`). Cross-browser CI deferred per CONTEXT.md (Chromium-only by default; Firefox/WebKit opt-in via local invocation) (45-01..05).
- `/hub` is now a unified tabbed shell with three tabs in order Protocols / Workflows / Marketplace (Radix Tabs via the existing shadcn wrapper). URL contract is `?tab=protocols|workflows|marketplace`, updated via `router.replace(url, { scroll: false })`. Default tab when `?tab=` is absent is **Protocols** (overrides original HUBV2-01 "Workflows" default per Phase-44 CONTEXT.md user accept; REQUIREMENTS.md HUBV2-01 reworded). Page hero is "Hub" + "Browse protocols, fork community workflows, and discover paid services on the marketplace." (`components/hub/hub-hero.tsx`, mounted once at the page-shell level). Tab strip ships with a per-active-tab search slot (`HubTabSearch`); cross-tab unified search wiring is deferred. Single "Hub" left-nav entry (no secondary Marketplace link) per MARKET-11. Marketplace is a tab on `/hub` ONLY; the original standalone `/marketplace` route from the v1 plan was explicitly NOT created (ROADMAP success #8). Marketplace tab body is a server component (`app/hub/_marketplace-tab.tsx`) running a Drizzle GROUP-BY join over `workflows ⋈ workflow_payments`, wrapped in `unstable_cache(300s)`, with cursor pagination `LIMIT 50` on `(callCount DESC, workflowId)` tiebreaker. SELECT explicitly whitelists public columns; rendered HTML contains zero leaks of `creatorWalletAddress`, `userId`, `organizationId`, `payerAddress`, or precise `amountUsdc` (live-verified via real Chrome MCP). Sort dropdown shows two options only — Popular (default) and Newest; Earnings sort is EXPLICITLY ABSENT (deferred to v1.11.x or v1.12 per MARKET-FUTURE-01). MCP API extension: `GET /api/mcp/workflows?sort=popular|recent` and `search_workflows` MCP tool gain matching `sort` parameter; MCP tool count unchanged. The composite `(workflow_id, settled_at)` index on `workflow_payments` was reviewed via EXPLAIN ANALYZE and intentionally NOT added (existing `idx_workflow_payments_workflow` covers the GROUP-BY plan; revisit when MARKET-FUTURE-02 time-window leaderboards land). Phase-43 contracts (sidebar Sort+Tags, Cards/List toggle, hub_view cookie, Use-template CTA, pending_template OAuth round-trip, tag deep-link route) preserved INSIDE the Workflows tab; the inline Protocols strip and "Templates" header/divider that lived above the Phase-43 tile grid were deleted. No "Listed in marketplace" badge on Workflows-tab cards (HUBV2-08 / MARKET-10 SUPERSEDED); the marketplace-badge slot in `workflow-template-row.tsx` stays as a comment marker. Phase 44 commit anchor: `ce826a7a` (44-04 hero rewrite) → `86f0b6c7` (44-12 lint baseline clear ahead of UAT); 23 functional commits across 12 plans (44-01..44-12) plus the 44-12 lint-clean commit. UAT GREEN; 11/11 manual cases verified live in real Chrome via MCP at 1280x800; Phase-43 regression sweep PASS by construction (Workflows tab body lifted unchanged) + sampled live; observed `navType="reload"` on `history.back()` to `/hub?tab=marketplace` confirms the Phase-45 root-layout bfcache fix recovers hydration on tab-driven URL changes too; one non-blocking note documented (body-text "Earnings" hit traces to navigation-sidebar nav menu item, NOT the Marketplace sort dropdown — MARKET-02 contract holds); FF/Safari sweep deferred per same precedent as Phase 45 (44-12).
